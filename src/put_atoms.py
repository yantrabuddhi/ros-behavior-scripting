#from opencog.atomspace import AtomSpace, TruthValue
# Simple API to isolate opencog atoms and imports from the ROS code,
# so that we don't hack both ROS and Opencog in the same module.
# Why? Not sure, seemed like a good idea at the time.
#
# How to unit-test:
# -----------------
# This class pokes atoms into an AtomSpace. It should be the same
# AtomSpace as the one that the rest of the system is using; in
# particular, it should be the one that the behavior tree is defined
# in. This can be manually tested like so:
#
#     pat = PutAtoms()
#     pat.btree_stop()
#     pat.btree_run()
#
# If everything is hooked up OK, then `pat.btree_run()` should start
# the btree running.  If the AtomSpace is borked, it will complain
# that some DefinedPredicateNode is not defined, and will do nothing at
# all (because, duhh, there's no DefinedPredicateNode in the bad
# AtomSpace). Since you only have a guile prompt, and not a python
# prompt, you'll need to actually do this:
#
#    (python-eval "from put_atoms import *")
#    (python-eval "pat = PutAtoms()\npat.btree_stop()")
#    (python-eval "pat = PutAtoms()\npat.btree_run()")
#
