# atomic.py - OpenCog python schema to control Eva.
#
# This is a wrapper around a ROS node that is able to control the Eva
# blender model. This wrapper is desined so that each function can be
# called by OpenCog, from a GroundedPredicateNode. The functions are
# simple, and correspond more-or-less directly to the Eva API: the
# blender API can be told to play the smile animation, or the blink
# animation, or frown, fall asleep, turn, look, and so on.
